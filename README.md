# crowd-counting-scnn
This project is an implementation of the crowd counting model proposed in our CVPR 2017 paper - Switching Convolutional Neural Network(SCNN) for Crowd Counting. SCNN is an adaptation of the fully-convolutional neural network  and uses an expert CNN that chooses the best crowd density CNN regressor for parts of the scene from a bag of regressors. This helps it tackle intra-scene crowd density variation and obtain SOTA results
